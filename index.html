                    <h3>Muscles Used</h3>
                    The chest press machine primarily targets the muscles of the chest (pectoralis major), shoulders (anterior deltoids), and triceps. The movement involves pushing the handles or weights away from the body, which engages the pectoral muscles. Additionally, the anterior deltoids contribute to the shoulder movement, and the triceps assist in extending the elbow joint during the pressing motion.

                <div class = "How-to-use">
                    <h4>How To Use</h4>
                    <p>Adjust the chest press machine seat to chest level, ensuring a firm backrest contact.</p>
                    <p>Select an appropriate weight on the machine's stack, adjusting the pin accordingly.</p>
                    <p>Sit with feet flat, grasp handles with an overhand grip, and align hands with chest.</p>
                    <p>Press the handles forward, extending arms without locking elbows, exhaling during the motion.</p>
                    <p>Slowly return to the starting position, bending elbows, and inhale, completing controlled repetitions.</p>

                    The chest press machine allows you to increase the size and strength of your chest. Therefore if you’re a bodybuilder, rugby player, football player, hockey player, martial artist, and wrestler, this can be a good machine to add to your chest muscle and strengthen it. Basically, if you take part in a sport or work in a profession that requires a lot of pushing and heavy moving, this will benefit you.

                    <p>Pectoralis Major: The largest muscle of the chest, responsible for the main pressing action.</p>
                    <p>Anterior Deltoids: The front part of the shoulder muscles, which assists in lifting the weight.</p>
                    <p>Triceps Brachii: Located at the back of the upper arm, the triceps help extend the elbow joint during the upward phase of the bench press.</p>

                    The bench press is not seen as a functional form of fitness, so it’s not mandatory for most athletes to use. However, if your sole intention is bodybuilding, this is a great form of gym equipment to help you build muscle around your chest.
